## Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

**Object Oriented Programming**, often referred to as **OOP**, is a programming paradigm that was created to deal with the growing complexity of large software systems. Programmers found out very early on that as applications grew in complexity and size, they became very difficult to maintain. One small change at any point in the program would trigger a ripple effect of errors due to dependencies throughout the entire program.

**OOP** was introduced as a way to section off areas of code that perform certain procedures so that program could become interactions of many small parts, rather than one large dependant piece.

## Encapsulation

**Encapsulation** is the process of hiding pieces of functionality and making it unavailable to the rest of the code base. It is a form of data protection, so that data cannot be manipulated or changed without obvious intention. It is what defines the boundaries in your application and allows your code to achieve new levels of complexity. 

**Ruby**, like many other OO languages, accomplishes this task by creating objects, and exposing interfaces (i.e. methods) to interact with those objects.

This also has the added benefit of abstraction, where objects represent nouns and can be given methods (verbs/actions) that describe the behavior.

## Polymorphism

**Polymorphism** is the ability for different types of data to respond to a common interface. For instance, if we have a method that invokes the `move` method on its argument, we can pass the method any type of argument as long as the argument has a compatible `move` method. The object might represent a human, a cat, a jellyfish, or, conceivably, even a car or train. That is, it lets objects of different types respond to the same method invocation.
